p. A tokenizer of type @pattern@ that can flexibly separate text into terms via a regular expression. Accepts the following settings:

|_. Setting |_. Description |
|@pattern@|The regular expression pattern, defaults to @\\W+@.|
|@flags@|The regular expression flags.|
|@group@|Which group to extract into tokens. Defaults to @-1@ (split).|

p. *IMPORTANT*: The regular expression should match the *token separators*, not the tokens themselves.

p. @group@ set to @-1@ (the default) is equivalent to "split". Using group >= 0 selects the matching group as the token. For example, if you have:

<pre>
pattern = \\'([^\']+)\\'
group = 0
input = aaa 'bbb' 'ccc'
</pre>

p. the output will be two tokens: 'bbb' and 'ccc' (including the ' marks).  With the same input but using group=1, the output would be: bbb and ccc (no ' marks).
