**The S3 gateway is deprecated and will be removed in a future version. Please use the "local gateway":/guide/reference/modules/gateway/local.html instead.**

p. S3 based gateway allows to do long term reliable async persistency of the cluster state and indices directly to Amazon S3. Here is how it can be configured:

<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
cloud:
    aws:
        access_key: AKVAIQBF2RECL7FJWGJQ
        secret_key: vExyMThREXeRMm/b/LRzEB8jWwvzQeXgjqMX+6br


gateway:
    type: s3
    s3:
        bucket: bucket_name
</pre>

p. Youâ€™ll need to install the @cloud-aws@ plugin, by running @bin/plugin install cloud-aws@ before (re)starting elasticsearch.

p. The following are a list of settings (prefixed with @gateway.s3@) that can further control the S3 gateway:

|_. Setting |_. Description |
|@chunk_size@|Big files are broken down into chunks (to overcome AWS 5g limit and use concurrent snapshotting). Default set to @100m@.|

h1. concurrent_streams

p. The @gateway.s3.concurrent_streams@ allow to throttle the number of streams (per node) opened against the shared gateway performing the snapshot operation. It defaults to @5@.

h1. Region

p. The @cloud.aws.region@ can be set to a region and will automatically use the relevant settings for both @ec2@ and @s3@. The available values are: @us-east-1@, @us-west-1@, @ap-southeast-1@, @eu-west-1@.
